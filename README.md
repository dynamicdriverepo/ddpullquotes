# jQuery Pull Quote with Animation
Pull Quotes are great for highlighting important bits of information inside an article, in addition to adding flare to long blocks of content that may otherwise scare away some readers.

To that end, this jQuery script makes it simple as pie to turn any inline text on your page into an automatic pullquote, with optional animation that plays to draw even more attention to them. Simply wrap any text with a SPAN tag, and the script will duplicate the content and position it outside the regular flow of the surrounding text to create an awesome pull quote.
